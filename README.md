## 3 things i want to try:
- using Google Lens in an app we're developing (or any scanning feature)
- how to properly choose an API to use as data source
- how to make a translation function work correctly

## 2 things i learned today
- the warnings during setup were not mistakes made, i spent too much tiome trying to address the warnings that it was extremely frustrating and i felt like i was doing something wrong
- i learned that we could have used Expo last term and made it easier for us to make the navigation for our web app project

## 1 word for how i'm feeling
- i feel hopeful because today made a lot of things clearer for me (how to do the setup and i have a better idea how to read documentations correctly)
